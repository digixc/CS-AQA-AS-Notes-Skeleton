<h2 id="fundamentals-of-computer-systems">3.6 3.6 Fundamentals of computer systems</h2>
<h3 id="hardware-and-software">3.6.1 Hardware and software</h3>
<h4 id="relationship-between-hardware-and-software">3.6.1.1 Relationship between hardware and software</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understand the relationship between hardware and software and be able to define the terms:
<ul>
<li>hardware</li>
<li>software</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="classification-of-software">3.6.1.2 Classification of software</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain what is meant by:
<ul>
<li>system software</li>
<li>application software.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Understand the need for, and attributes of, different types of software.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="system-software">3.6.1.3 System software</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understand the need for, and functions of the following system software:
<ul>
<li>operating systems (OSs)</li>
<li>utility programs</li>
<li>libraries</li>
<li>translators (compiler, assembler, interpreter).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="role-of-an-operating-system-os">3.6.1.4 Role of an operating system (OS)</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Understand that the role of the operating system is to create a virtual machine. This means that the complexities of the hardware are hidden from the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Know that the OS handles resource management, managing hardware to allocate processors, memories and I/O devices among competing processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classification-of-programming-languages">3.6.2 Classification of programming languages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Show awareness of the development of types of programming languages and their classification into low-and high-level languages.</li>
<li>Know that low-level languages are considered to be:
<ul>
<li>machine-code</li>
<li>assembly language.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Know that high-level languages include imperative high level-language.</li>
<li>Describe machine-code language and assembly language.</li>
<li>Understand the advantages and disadvantages of machine-code and assembly language programming compared with high-level language programming.</li>
<li>Explain the term ‘imperative high-level language’ and its relationship to low-level languages.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-program-translator">3.6.3 Types of program translator</h3>
<h4 id="types-of-program-translator-1">3.6.3.1 Types of program translator</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understand the role of each of the following:
<ul>
<li>assembler</li>
<li>compiler</li>
<li>interpreter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Explain the differences between compilation and interpretation. Describe situations in which each would be appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why an intermediate language such as bytecode is produced as the final output by some compilers and how it is subsequently used.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the difference between source and object (executable) code.</p></li>
</ul>
